# SQL_Project_COVID19_Data_Analysis
SQL project to analyze COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination data

This project is suitable for beginners and intermediate learners, guiding you through analyzing a COVID-19 dataset using SQL. You will explore infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination progress to derive insights about the pandemic's impact across countries and continents.

**Complete project explanation**: Not available, but the script is well-commented for self-guided learning.

## Database and Tools
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or compatible SQL client
- Schema: `[Portfolio Project]` (contains `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations` tables)

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze COVID-19 data to understand trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations globally and by region. It aims to calculate key metrics such as death percentages, infection rates relative to population, and vaccination coverage, providing actionable insights for public health assessments.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic, including country-specific infection and mortality rates, continental death counts, and vaccination progress. The use of SQL queries, CTEs, temporary tables, and a view demonstrates a robust approach to data exploration and visualization preparation. Future enhancements could include adding error handling, date range filters, and additional metrics like recovery rates to deepen the analysis.
